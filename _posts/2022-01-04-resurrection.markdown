I was looking for a place to keep notes or a journal regarding the things I've been doing with my home computer setup so I can refer back in the future. I'm not planning on including any private or confidential information, so I don't have too much concern with hosting it up on this blog.

Expect to see lots of notes about extracting myself from Google with the help of [Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com), [Proxmox Backup Server](https://pbs.proxmox.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), and [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/) in the short term.

I'm curious to see how much energy I can maintain in writing this. Only time will tell.
