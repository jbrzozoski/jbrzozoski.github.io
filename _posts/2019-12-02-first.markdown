Just setup Jekyll with default settings.  In looking around, my first two questions are:
1. Why does the `title` field appear so many times in the header/footer of the default theme?
2. What does the `categories` field do in the front matter of posts?

I'm sure I'll have a lot more questions as I look around, I just want to actually make a post.
